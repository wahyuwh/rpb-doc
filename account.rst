User Creation
=============

It is necessary to create two user accounts for each user. One is the main account in RPB database and the second one is linked account for the access to EDC system (OpenClinica). For internal users we try to follow the usernames already existing in active directory. The user names are case sensitive however RPB-portal login is automatically converting them into small cases so they should appear as case insensitive to the end user (however [[OpenClinica]] is always case sensitive).
